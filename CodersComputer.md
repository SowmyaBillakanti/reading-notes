# Reading file

## Different Classifications of Text Editors
1. Simple Text Editor (like Notepad)
2. Advanced Text Editor (like Notepad++)
3. Command Text Editor (like nano)
4. IDEs (like VSCode)

## What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

## The Difference Between Text
### Editors and IDEs
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the titleâ€”it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook.

## Why choose a good editor?
For simple scripts, a simple text editor like notepad or nano would be sufficient. But, for complex actions like creating a website, something more advanced like VSCode would be necessary to simplify actions like auto-complete, syntax highlighting, and debugging.

## Basic Terminal Usage Cheatsheet

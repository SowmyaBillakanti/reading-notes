### Growth Mindset
What Growth Mindset means to me : Growth mindset leads to more productivity and productivity leads to people feeling better. Believe in your abilities and it can help in team work and strong team. We try to face the challenges instead of avoiding, we learn from critisism instead of ignoring, will be inspired by success of others but not feel as a threat and we also learn to face obstacles.

> Great works are performed, not by strength, but by perseverance - Samuel Johnson

### Reminders to keep myself in a Growth Minndset
* Learn from mistakes
* Not comparing with others
* Face obstacles and learn from them

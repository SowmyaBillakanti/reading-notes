# Database Normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. Take a spreadsheet containing the information as an example, where the data contains salespeople and customers serving several purposes:
Identify salespeople in your organization
List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product
Identify which salespeople call on specific customers.
By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.

## Reasons for Database Normalization
Three main reasons:
1. To minimise duplicate data
2. To minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. To simplify queries

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
Duplicated information presents two problems:
1. It increases storage and decrease performance.
2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.

## There are three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. They are also abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF respectively. 

1. First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
2. Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
3. Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key

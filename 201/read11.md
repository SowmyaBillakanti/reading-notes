## HOW FLASH WORKS
Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.
Whether you are creating an animation or a media player in Flash, the files you put on your website are referred to as Flash movies.

If you want to create your own Flash movie, you need to purchase the Flash authoring environment from Adobe.

There are, however, several companies that offer Flash animations and slideshows, as well as video and audio players that you can use without purchasing this tool.

## USE OF FLASH
Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.

When Flash was first released, it was developed to create animations. The technology quickly evolved, however, and people started to use it to build media players and even entire websites.

## ADDING A FLASH MOVIE TO YOUR WEB PAGE
The most popular way of adding Flash into a web page is using JavaScript. There are several scripts that allow you to do this without an in-depth understanding of the JavaScript language.

The script we will be looking at here is called SWFObject. You can obtain a copy of it for free from Google, and you can see how we use it on the next page.

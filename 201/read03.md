# LISTS
* Numbered lists
* Bullet lists
* Definition lists

### There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
* Ordered lists
* Unordered lists
* Definition lists

###   SUMMARY LISTS
1. There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
2. Ordered lists use numbers.
3. Unordered lists use bullets.
4. Definition lists are used to define terminology.
5. Lists can be nested inside one another.

# BOXES
* Controlling size of boxes
* Box model for borders, margin and padding
* Displaying and hiding

### We can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. we will see how to:

Control the dimensions of your boxes
Create borders around boxes
Set margins and padding for boxes
Show and hide boxes

### BOX DIMENSIONS
* WIDTH 
* HEIGHT

### BORDER, MARGIN & PADDING
#### BORDER
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

#### MARGIN
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

#### PADDING
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

### CHANGE INLINE/BLOCK
#### Display
The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.

The values this property can take are:

#### inline
This causes a block-level element to act like an inline element.

#### block
This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.

#### inline-block
This causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element, while retaining other features of a block-level element.

#### none
This hides an element from the page. In this case, the element acts as though it is not on the page at all (although a user could still see the content of the box if they used the view source option in their browser).

If you use this property, it is important to note that inline boxes are not supposed to create block-level elements.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions
### WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

### DATA TYPES
* NUMERIC DATA TYPE
* STRING DATA TYPE
* BOOLEAN DATA TYPE

### ARRAYS
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

### VALUES IN ARRAYS
* NUMBERING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY
* ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY
* NUMBER OF ITEMS IN AN ARRAY

### EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

### OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

# Decisions and Loops
DECISIONS: Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.
LOOPS: There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.

### EVALUATING CONDITIONS & CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
There are two components to a decision:
1: An expression is evaluated, which returns a value
2: A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation

### COMPARISON OPERATORS: EVALUATING CONDITIONS
== is equal to
!= is not equal to
`===` is strict equal to
`!==` is strict not equal to
`>` is greater than
`<` is less than
`>=` is greater than or equal to
`<=` is less than or equal to

### LOGICAL OPERATORS
Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

&& logical and
|| is logical or
! logical not

### IF STATEMENTS
The if statement evaluates (or checks) a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.

### IF…ELSE STATEMENTS
The if…else statement checks a condition. If it resolves to true the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead.

### SWITCH STATEMENTS
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

### LOOPS
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:
1. For
2. While
3. Do While

### KEY LOOP CONCEPTS
Here are three points to consider when you are working with loops. Each is illustrated in examples on the following three pages.

KEYWORDS
You will commonly see these two keywords used with loops:
* break
* continue

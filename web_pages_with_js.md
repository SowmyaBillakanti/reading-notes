## CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.

## LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML `<script>` element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

Open the HTML file in your browser. You should see that the JavaScript has added a greeting (in this case, Good Afternoon!) to the page. (These greetings are coming from the JavaScript file; they are not in the HTML file.)

## THE SOURCE CODE IS NOT AMENDED
If you look at the source code for the example you just created, you will see that the HTML is still exactly the same.

The source of the web page does not actually show the new element that has been added into the page; it just shows the link to the JavaScript file.

PLACING THE SCRIPT IN THE PAGE
You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening `<script>` and closing `</script>` tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).

Open the HTML file in your web browser and the welcome greeting is written into the page.

# Hooks API

### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
Single-page website can not always represent complete information.

### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Inside the `<BrowserRouter/>`, outside a `<Route/>`

### What does props.children contain?
It displays whatever we include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

## Term
### Composition
Combining multiple components to achieve a particular goal

### Children / Child Components
Allows us to pass components as data to other components

### Hash Routing
Hash-based routing. What we meant by hash-based routing is using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content.

### Link Routing
The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network.

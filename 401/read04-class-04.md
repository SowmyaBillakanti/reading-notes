# Review, Research, and Discussion

### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1. To make code meet design expectations raather than make design expectations meet code.
2. To ensure all the design considerations are explicit.
3. Save project costs in the long run

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
* beforeEach() - setup needed for a test case. For Ex: Login into an account before testing the app.
* afterEach() - Clearing the setup after a test case. For Ex: Logout from an account after testing the app.

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
1. It can hurt developer morale as it is an exhaustive process even before the first line of code is written.

### Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
* ES6 classes are more readable

### Why REST?
* It is a common interface definition language that enables easy migrations and knowledge sharing.

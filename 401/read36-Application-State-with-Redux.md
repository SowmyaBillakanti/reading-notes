### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
Both localStorage and cookies are vulnerable to XSS attacks but it's harder for the attacker to do the attack when you're using httpOnly cookies.
Cookies are vulnerable to CSRF attacks but it can be mitigated using sameSite flag and anti-CSRF tokens.

### Explain 3rd party cookies.
Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. 

### How do pixel tags work?
A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. ... The tracking pixel URL is the memory location on the server. When the user visits a website, the image with the tag is loaded from this server.


## Terms
### cookies
Information stored on client computer

### authorization
The HTTP Authorization request header contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a server, usually, but not necessarily, after the server has responded with a 401 Unauthorized status and the WWW-Authenticate header.

### access control
Access control models are responsible for granting or restricting access to resources. They depend on two things: user identification (verified by one or more authentication schemes) and feature authorization.

### conditional rendering
Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

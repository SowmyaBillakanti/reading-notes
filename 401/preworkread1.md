# How to Solve Programming problems

## A simple set of steps to follow which we can use for any algorithm type programming problem:

* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.

### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
Redux Toolkit is a package that intends to reduce some of the React boilerplate and be a standard way to write Redux logic.
Ducks is a modular pattern that collocates actions, action types and reducers.

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
It allows us to write more efficient code, speed up the development process, and automatically apply the best-recommended practices. It was mainly created to solve the THREE MAJOR ISSUES with Redux: Configuring a Redux store is too complicated. Have to add a lot of packages to build a large scale application.


### Term
#### redux toolkit slices
A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

#### namespace
In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.

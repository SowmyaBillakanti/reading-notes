# Review, Research, and Discussion

## “Singleton”
- The singleton design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance, typically through the use of a private constructor method.

## how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
When instantiating a class, using CONST will keep the methods within from changing and will keep new properties from being added. Node modules can help keep similar chunks of code organized and for us so we know where to find it and are able to export it to work with other areas of our code.

## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- First, what software would be used for
- Target user
- Needs

# Terms

### Router Middleware
- Middleware functions like signposts along the way for the train track of the request object. Router is a type of Express middlware that handles requests and sends them via the approproate route.

### Dynamic Module Loading
- Loading the entire program into the main memory before start of the program execution is called as static loading. Loading the program into the main memory on demand is called as dynamic loading.

### Singleton Pattern
- Singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

### CRUD -> REST Method Matches
* GET - READ
* POST - CREATE
* PUT - UPDATE
* DELETE - DELETE

### Mock Testing
- Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones.

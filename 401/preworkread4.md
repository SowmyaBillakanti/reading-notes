# 5 Whys

The 5 Whys technique is most effective when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the process or problem in question.

The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.

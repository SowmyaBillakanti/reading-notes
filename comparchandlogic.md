# How Computers work
* How information is represented inside the computer
* Using tiny electrical signals
* How computers use circuits
* How software controls hardware

# What makes a computer, a computer?
* Take input
* Storage
* Processing
* Output the result

# Binary and Data
*  Computer works on 1's and 0's
* Wires and Circuits carry all the information in a computer
* More wires you get more bits you can represent more complex information
* Any number, text, images, videos, sound  are represented with only 1 and 0

# Circuits and Logic
* Millions of tiny electronic components will come together to form a circuits
* Circuits turns binary signals into videos, games, websites and helps to decode DNA

# CPU, Memory, Input and Output
* Takes inputs and converts into Binary information
* Memory stores information
* CPU calculates information
* Output devices that take information and convert it into a physical output.

# Hardware and Software
*  What you see in Hardware : Circuits, Chips, Wires, speakers, plugs and stuff.
* What we dont see is a Software: Like computer programs, or code, running on the machine. 
Software can be anything from apps and games to webpages and the data science software
# How Hardware and Software interact with one another
* CPU is the masther chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
* It has circuits to do Math and logic and other circuits to send and receive information from different parts of the computer
* Operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
